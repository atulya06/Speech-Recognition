Speech Recognition by matching patterns using Cross-Correlation Technique in MATLAB.
An algorithm is created in MATLAB to record reference audio files.
The recorded files are stored in a database.
Patterns of the test files are matched with that of the uploaded file using a simple algorithm on cross-correlation written in MATLAB.
